# Low Logic Challenge - HTB 824

## Challenge Overview
This HackTheBox challenge is an entry-level hardware task that revolves around digital logic.  
The goal is to determine the correct boolean expression to process a set of binary inputs, ultimately revealing the hidden flag.  
The challenge tests fundamental knowledge of logic gates and basic scripting.

- **Difficulty:** Very Easy  
- **Category:** Hardware  
- **Platform:** HackTheBox  
- **Key Skills:** Boolean Logic, Scripting (Python)  

The challenge provides two files:
- `chip.jpg` → An image of an SN74HC11N integrated circuit.  
- `input.csv` → A CSV file with 200 rows of four binary inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`).  

A quick search shows the SN74HC11N is a **triple 3-input AND gate**. Since the dataset has four inputs instead of three, some combination of gates must be applied.

## Solution

### Step 1: Discover the Boolean Logic
The correct boolean expression is:

```
(in0 AND in1) OR (in2 AND in3)
```

### Step 2: Script the Solution
Each row of the CSV is processed with the above logic. The results (`0` or `1`) are concatenated into a binary string, which is then converted into ASCII text to reveal the flag.

#### Python Solver Script

```python
import csv

# This will store the final binary string
binary_result = ''

# The boolean logic function
def apply_logic(inputs):
    """
    Applies the logic (in0 AND in1) OR (in2 AND in3) to a list of inputs.
    """
    in0 = int(inputs[0])
    in1 = int(inputs[1])
    in2 = int(inputs[2])
    in3 = int(inputs[3])
    result = (in0 and in1) or (in2 and in3)
    return result

# Open and read the input.csv file
with open('input.csv', mode='r') as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    next(csv_reader) # Skip header
    
    # Process each row
    for row in csv_reader:
        output = apply_logic(row)
        binary_result += str(output)

# The binary string has 199 bits, so we truncate to the nearest multiple of 8 (192)
num_bits = len(binary_result)
num_bytes = num_bits // 8
flag_binary = binary_result[:num_bytes * 8]

# Convert binary to string to get the flag
flag = int(flag_binary, 2).to_bytes(num_bytes, 'big').decode()

print(f"[*] Decoded Flag: {flag}")
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Hardware as a Hint:** Chip datasheets can provide essential clues in reversing challenges.  
- **Boolean Fundamentals:** Understanding basic logic operations is critical for hardware and reversing tasks.  
- **Automation:** Scripting accelerates repetitive decoding and binary-to-text conversion.
