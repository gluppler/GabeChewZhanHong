# Low Logic - Digital Logic Reversing

## Challenge Overview
This HackTheBox challenge is an entry-level hardware task that revolves around digital logic.  
The goal is to determine the correct boolean expression to process a set of binary inputs, ultimately revealing the hidden flag.  
The challenge tests fundamental knowledge of logic gates and basic scripting.

---

## Challenge Info
- **Difficulty:** Very Easy  
- **Category:** Hardware  
- **Platform:** HackTheBox  
- **Key Skills:** Boolean Logic, Scripting (Python)  

---

## Initial Analysis
The downloaded challenge files contain two key items:  

- **`chip.jpg`** → An image of an `SN74HC11N` integrated circuit.  
- **`input.csv`** → A CSV file with 200 rows of four binary inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`).  

A quick search for the **SN74HC11N** chip reveals it's a **triple 3-input AND gate**. This is the primary clue, pointing towards an AND operation being central to the solution.  

However, the CSV file has **four inputs** while the chip itself only defines a 3-input AND. This suggests that some **combination of logic operations** is required.

---

## Solution Steps
The solution can be broken into two main parts:  

### 1. Discover the Boolean Logic
Through some experimentation, the correct expression is determined to be:

```

(in0 AND in1) OR (in2 AND in3)

````

This expression is applied to each row of the `input.csv` file.  

### 2. Script the Solution
The results of the boolean operation (either `1` or `0`) for each row are concatenated into a **long binary string**.  
This binary string is then converted into ASCII text to reveal the **flag**.

## Python Solver Script

```python
import csv

# This will store the final binary string
binary_result = ''

# The boolean logic function
def apply_logic(inputs):
    """
    Applies the logic (in0 AND in1) OR (in2 AND in3) to a list of inputs.
    """
    in0 = int(inputs[0])
    in1 = int(inputs[1])
    in2 = int(inputs[2])
    in3 = int(inputs[3])
    result = (in0 and in1) or (in2 and in3)
    return result

# Open and read the input.csv file
with open('input.csv', mode='r') as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    next(csv_reader) # Skip header
    
    # Process each row
    for row in csv_reader:
        output = apply_logic(row)
        binary_result += str(output)

# The binary string has 199 bits, so we truncate to the nearest multiple of 8 (192)
num_bits = len(binary_result)
num_bytes = num_bits // 8
flag_binary = binary_result[:num_bytes * 8]

# Convert binary to string to get the flag
flag = int(flag_binary, 2).to_bytes(num_bytes, 'big').decode()

print(f"[*] Decoded Flag: {flag}")
````

## Tools and Resources

* **Python 3** → For scripting the solution.
* **Text Editor** (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++, etc.) → To write the script.
* **Web Browser** → To research the datasheet of the `SN74HC11N` chip.

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Hardware as a Hint:** Physical components or datasheets can provide crucial clues in reversing challenges.
* **Fundamental Logic:** A solid understanding of basic boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) is essential in many areas of cybersecurity.
* **Automation is Key:** Scripting allows efficient processing of large datasets or repetitive tasks.
