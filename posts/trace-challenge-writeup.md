Challenge Overview: Decoding GPIO SignalsThe "Trace" challenge from HackTheBox is a fantastic exercise in signal analysis and protocol reverse engineering. We're provided with a CSV file (traces.csv) containing timestamped logic level traces from a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, along with a text file (trace.txt) mapping those pins to the rows and columns of an 8x8 LED matrix. The goal is to reconstruct the visual data being displayed on the matrix to reveal the flag.Note: You'll need to upload your raspberry-pi-pinout.png to an image host like Imgur and replace the URL above.Step 1: Understanding the Hardware SetupThe trace.txt file is our Rosetta Stone for this challenge. It tells us exactly how the LED matrix is wired to the Raspberry Pi:Rows (Common Anode): Controlled by GPIO pins 12, 25, 24, 22, 27, 17, 18, and 23. To light up a row, its corresponding GPIO pin must be set to HIGH (1).Columns (Common Cathode): Controlled by GPIO pins 16, 5, 6, 13, 19, 26, 20, and 21. To light up a column, its corresponding GPIO pin must be set to LOW (0).Therefore, a specific LED at (row, col) will turn on only when its row pin is HIGH and its column pin is LOW. This multiplexing technique is common for controlling LED matrices efficiently.Step 2: Scripting the Signal ReconstructionThe core of the solution lies in the trace.py script. It's designed to parse the CSV data, reconstruct the state of the 8x8 matrix at each timestamp, and then identify the characters being displayed.Key Logic in trace.py:Data Loading: The script loads traces.csv into a pandas DataFrame for efficient manipulation.State Reconstruction: For each timestamp, it checks the state of all 16 relevant GPIO pins. Using vectorized operations with NumPy, it builds an 8x8 matrix representing the on/off state of each LED. An LED at [row, col] is considered ON if ROW_GPIO[row] == 1 and COL_GPIO[col] == 0.Frame Aggregation: Because of multiplexing, the full image of a character is never displayed at once. The script intelligently groups frames that are close together in time to form a composite image of each character.Character Recognition: A dictionary of pre-defined 8x8 NumPy arrays (CHARACTER_TEMPLATES) represents the pixel patterns for each possible character (A-Z, 0-9, symbols). The script compares each composite frame against these templates to find the best match.Animation & Flag Recovery: Finally, the script concatenates the recognized characters to form the final string and uses Matplotlib to generate a GIF animation of the reconstructed frames, visually confirming the decoded message.# Snippet from trace.py showing the core reconstruction logic

def reconstruct_pixel_states_vectorized(df_gpio_data, df_gpio_data_np):
    # ... (GPIO index mapping) ...

    # Get all row and column data across all timestamps
    row_data_by_time = df_gpio_data_np[:, row_gpio_indices]
    col_data_by_time = df_gpio_data_np[:, col_gpio_indices]

    # Transpose for broadcasting
    row_data = row_data_by_time.T
    col_data = col_data_by_time.T

    # Use NumPy broadcasting to compute the state of all 64 LEDs at once
    # for every single timestamp in the trace file.
    led_states = (row_data[:, np.newaxis, :] == 1) & (col_data[np.newaxis, :, :] == 0)
    return led_states.astype(int)
Step 3: Revealing the FlagRunning the script processes the entire traces.csv file, deciphers the message being displayed on the LED matrix, and prints the flag to the console.Note: You'll need to upload your matrix_animation.gif to an image host like Imgur and replace the URL above.The final flag is revealed: HTB{MU171P13X1N9_4ND_PC85_FUND1M3N7415_37}. This challenge was a superb deep dive into GPIO signal analysis, multiplexing, and data-driven hardware reverse engineering.
